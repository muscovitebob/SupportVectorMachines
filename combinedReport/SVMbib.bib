  abstract = {Finding new molecules with a desired biological activity is an extremely difficult task. In this context, artificial intelligence and generative models have been used for molecular de novo design and compound optimization. Herein, we report the first generative model that bridges systems biology and molecular design conditioning a generative adversarial network with transcriptomic data. By doing this we could generate molecules that have high probability to produce a desired biological effect at cellular level. We show that this model is able to design active-like molecules for desired targets without any previous target annotation of the training compounds as long as the gene expression signature of the desired state is provided. The molecules generated by this model are more similar to active compounds than the ones identified by similarity of gene expression signatures, which is the state-of-the-art method for navigating compound-induced gene expression data. Overall, this method represents a novel way to bridge chemistry and biology to advance in the long and difficult road of drug discovery.},

However, in most of the cases, especially in complex diseases, even given a list of biomarkers, the underlying biological mechanisms are still obscure to us. In other words, rather than knowing what genes are involved, we are more interested in discovering the common, collective roles of all these genes. Based on the assumption that genes involved in the same biological processes, functions, or localizations present correlated behaviors in terms of expression levels, signal intensities, allele occurrences, and so on, we can therefore apply statistical tests to find perturbed pathways. Gene Set/Pathway enrichment analysis is one of such techniques; a step-by-step instruction is described in this chapter.},

A novel high-throughput gene-expression profiling assay known as L1000 was the main technology used to generate more than a million transcriptional profiles. The profiles are based on the treatment of 14 cell lines with one of many perturbation agents of interest at a single concentration for 6 and 24 hours duration. In this study, we focus on the chemical compound treatments within the LINCS data set. The experimental variables available include number of replicates, cell lines, and time points. Our study reveals that compound characterization based on three cell lines at two time points results in more genes being affected than six cell lines at a single time point. Based on the available LINCS data, we conclude that the most optimal experimental design to characterize a large set of compounds is to test them in duplicate in three different cell lines. Our conclusions are constrained by the fact that the compounds were profiled at a single, relative high concentration, and the longer time point is likely to result in phenotypic rather than mechanistic effects being recorded.},

  abstract = {By adding biological information, beyond the chemical properties and desired effect of a compound, uncharted compound areas and connections can be explored.

We demonstrate that the transcriptional connection score is best computed from the significant genes only and should be interpreted within its confidence interval for which we provide the stats. These guidelines help to reduce noise, increase reproducibility, and enable the separation of specific and promiscuous compounds. The added value of machine learning is demonstrated for the NR3C1 and HSP90 targets. Support Vector Machine models yielded balanced accuracy values \textdaggerdbl{}80\% when the expression values from DDIT4 \& SERPINE1 and TMEM97 \& SPR were used to predict the NR3C1 and HSP90 activity, respectively. Combining both models resulted in 22 new and confirmed HSP90-independent NR3C1 inhibitors, providing two scaffolds (i.e., pyrimidine and pyrazolo-pyrimidine), which could potentially be of interest in the treatment of depression (i.e., inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor (i.e., NR3C1), while leaving its chaperone, HSP90, unaffected). As such, the initial hit rate increased by a factor 300, as less, but more specific chemistry could be screened, based on the upfront computed activity predictions.},

Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

Despite the suggestion that regulatory element disruption represents a common theme, identifying causal risk variants within indicted genomic regions remains a significant challenge. Here we present a novel sequence-based computational method to predict the effect of regulatory variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) which encodes cell-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic context, and accurately predicts the results of dense mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays. Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores, and we predict novel risk SNPs for several autoimmune diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational approach for systematically identifying functional regulatory variants.},

Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

  title = {Cis-Topic Modelling of Single Cell Epigenomes},
  abstract = {Single-cell epigenomics provides new opportunities to decipher genomic regulatory programs from heterogeneous samples and dynamic processes. We present a probabilistic framework called cisTopic, to simultaneously discover "cis-regulatory topics" and stable cell states from sparse single-cell epigenomics data. After benchmarking cisTopic on single-cell ATAC-seq data, single-cell DNA methylation data, and semi-simulated single-cell ChIP-seq data, we use cisTopic to predict regulatory programs in the human brain and validate these by aligning them with co-expression networks derived from single-cell RNA-seq data. Next, we performed a time-series single-cell ATAC-seq experiment after SOX10 perturbations in melanoma cultures, where cisTopic revealed dynamic regulatory topics driven by SOX10 and AP-1. Finally, machine learning and enhancer modelling approaches allowed to predict cell type specific SOX10 and SOX9 binding sites based on topic specific co-regulatory motifs. cisTopic is available as an R/Bioconductor package at http://github.com/aertslab/cistopic.},

We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and \$400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to singlecell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution.},

The largest available dataset to date is the newly released L1000 compendium. With its 1.3 million gene expression profiles of treated human cells it offers many opportunities for biomedical data mining, but also data normalization challenges of new dimensions. We developed a novel and practical approach to obtain accurate estimates of fold change response profiles from L1000, based on the RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation) statistical framework. Extending RUV to a big data setting, we propose an estimation procedure, in which an underlying RUV model is tuned by feedback through dataset specific statistical measures, reflecting p-value distributions and internal gene knockdown controls. Applying these metrics \textendash{} termed evaluation endpoints \textendash{} to disjoint data splits and integrating the results to select an optimal normalization, the procedure reduces bias and noise in the L1000 data, which in turn broadens the potential of this resource for pharmacological and functional genomic analyses. Our pipeline and normalization results are distributed as an R package (nelanderlab.org/FC1000.html).},

There are a number of applications but in toxicology the most pertinent is for understanding mechanisms of toxicity. In its essence the process involves comparing a query gene signature generated as a result of exposure of a biological system to a chemical to those in a database that have been previously derived. In the ideal situation the query gene-expression signature is characteristic of the event and will be matched to similar events in the database. Key criteria are therefore the means of choosing the signature to be matched and the means by which the match is made. In this article we explore these concepts with examples applicable to toxicology.},

To better understand the pathophysiology of PE, the gene expression profiles of placental tissue from 5 controls and 5 PE patients were assessed using microarray. A total of 224 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed ({$>$}2-fold change and q value {$<$} 0.05, SAM software). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that genes involved in hypoxia and oxidative and reductive processes were significantly changed. Three differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in these biological processes were further verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Finally, the potential therapeutic agents for PE were explored via the Connectivity Map database. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study might provide clues to better understand the pathophysiology of PE and to identify potential therapeutic agents for PE patients.},

Among these analogues, 3y exhibited a better cytotoxic effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep 3B cells and displayed less cytotoxicity on normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells, compared with Sorafenib, a targeted therapy for advanced HCC. 3y also induced stronger apoptosis and autophagy. Addition of curcumin enhanced 3yinduced cytotoxicity by further induction of autophagy. Using gene expression signatures of 3y to query Connectivity Map, a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor (AR-A014418) was predicted to display similar molecular action of 3y. Experiments further demonstrate that AR-A014418 acted like 3y, and vice versa. Overall, our data suggest the chemotherapeutic potential of 3y on HCC.},

  abstract = {Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is of great importance to both regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. Various techniques, such as quantitative structureeactivity relationship (QSAR) and animal toxicology, are widely used to identify potential risks during the preclinical stage of drug development. Despite these efforts, drugs with safety liabilities can still pass through safety checkpoints and enter the market. This situation raises the concern that conventional chemical structure analysis and phenotypic screening are not sufficient to avoid all clinical adverse events. Genomic expression data following in vitro drug treatments characterize drug actions and thus have become widely used in drug repositioning. In the present study, we explored prediction of ADRs based on the drug-induced gene-expression profiles from cultured human cells in the Connectivity Map (CMap) database. The results showed that drugs inducing comparable ADRs generally lead to similar CMap expression profiles. Based on such ADR-gene expression association, we established prediction models for various ADRs, including severe myocardial and infectious events. Drugs with FDA boxed warnings of safety liability were effectively identified. We therefore suggest that drug-induced gene expression change, in combination with effective computational methods, may provide a new dimension of information to facilitate systematic drug safety evaluation.},

Using various benchmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover, transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action. Finally, we applied the classifier to all {$>$}20 000 small-molecules profiled, and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive small-molecule/ADR connections.},

Here, using L1000 microarray profiling obtained from JA-treated HCC cells, the z-score signatures of JA exhibited positive connectivity to known autophagy inducers among 3122 compounds from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database. JA-induced autophagy in HCC Hep 3B cells was confirmed by formation of acidic vesicular organelles and an increase in the expression of LC3-II and LAMP2a. JA-induced autophagic flux was demonstrated by accumulation of LC3-II and LAMP2a, as well as a decrease in colocalization of LC3 and LAMP2a puncta in the presence of autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Administration of bafilomycin A1 also demonstrated that JA-induced autophagy suppressed apoptosis. Activation of Ras/MEK/ERK pathway was observed. Following administration of apoptosis inhibitor zVAD, it was found that JA-induced apoptosis did not affect JA-induced autophagy. It is noteworthy that addition of JA promoted chemosensitivity of sorafenib, the only FDA-approved targeted therapy for advanced HCC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel strategy for rapid discovery of molecular actions of small molecules and suggest the applications of JA in HCC treatment.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Background: Interaction of a drug or chemical with a biological system can result in a geneexpression profile or signature characteristic of the event. Using a suitably robust algorithm these signatures can potentially be used to connect molecules with similar pharmacological or toxicological properties by gene expression profile. Lamb et al first proposed the Connectivity Map [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313, 1929\textendash{}1935] to make successful connections among small molecules, genes, and diseases using genomic signatures.
Results: Here we have built on the principles of the Connectivity Map to present a simpler and more robust method for the construction of reference gene-expression profiles and for the connection scoring scheme, which importantly allows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections observed. We tested the new method with two randomly generated gene signatures and three experimentally derived gene signatures (for HDAC inhibitors, estrogens, and immunosuppressive drugs, respectively). Our testing with this method indicates that it achieves a higher level of specificity and sensitivity and so advances the original method.
Conclusion: The method presented here not only offers more principled statistical procedures for testing connections, but more importantly it provides effective safeguard against false connections at the same time achieving increased sensitivity. With its robust performance, the method has potential use in the drug development pipeline for the early recognition of pharmacological and toxicological properties in chemicals and new drug candidates, and also more broadly in other 'omics sciences.},

  abstract = {Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular update rules used for ARD are either difficult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it remains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary functions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformulation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted 1 problems. The result is an efficient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature- and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promoting sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the methodology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation.},

We focus on kernel Principal Component Analysis (kernel PCA), which is a nonlinear extension of principal component analysis and has been used electively for extracting nonlinear features and reducing dimensionality. As a kernel method, kernel PCA also suffers from the problem of kernel choice. Although cross-validation is a popular method for choosing hyperparameters, it is not applicable straightforwardly to choose a kernel in kernel PCA because of the incomparable norms given by different kernels. It is important, thus, to develop a wellfounded method for choosing a kernel in kernel PCA. This study proposes a method for choosing hyperparameters in kernel PCA (kernel and the number of components) based on cross-validation for the comparable reconstruction errors of pre-images in the original space. The experimental results on synthesized and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully selects an appropriate kernel and the number of components in kernel PCA in terms of visualization and classification errors on the principal components. The results imply that the proposed method enables automatic design of hyperparameters in kernel PCA.},
